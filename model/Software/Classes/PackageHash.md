# PackageHash

## Summary

A verification method for software packages represented as a single blob of bytes, such as a tar archive or single executable.

## Description

The PackageHash is a hash of the single blob of bytes representing a software package.
The packageDownloadLocation should be a download locator that retrieves the package blob.  
A supplier can define a PackageHash in a Package without providing a PackageDownloadLocation. 
This lets consumers perform an offline verification of private blobs.
